=head1 NAME

YaBB3::DataSource::sql_base - Datasource base class for SQL-like backends

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides a base class for C<YaBB3::DataSource::*> modules that use DBI-based
sources for data

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new(option => 'value')

This functions is usually called by the YaBB3::DataSource module. It will
supply the user, password and database arguments based on the current board's
configuration.

=head3 Options

=over

=item db_type

This indicates what type of database we are connecting to. In most cases, this
is not set here and is instead initialized in the subclassed c<initialize()>
method.

=item user

This is the user to use for DB connection. It should be set by the user of the
module.

=item password

This is the password for the DB connection. It should be set by the user of
the module.

=item database

This is the name of the database to connect to. It should be set by the user
of the module.

=back

=head3 Return Value

Returns an object of the class that new was called in.

=head2 do_query( $sql, [ bind_values, ... ])

Behaves in accordance with the API defined in L<YaBB3::DataSource>

=head2 prepare( $sql )

Behaves in accordance with the API defined in L<YaBB3::DataSource>

=head1 STATEMENT HANDLERS

=head2 execute( bind_values, ... )

Behaves in accordance with the API defined in L<YaBB3::DataSource>

=head2 fetch( )

Behaves in accordance with the API defined in L<YaBB3::DataSource>

=head1 PROTECTED METHODS

These methods are for use in subclasses only and are not so be called by other
modules.

=head2 _initialize( $arg_ref )

This is not a method designed for public calling. It is for use only by this
class and it's sub-classes. (A protected method in C++ speak.)

This method is empty and is designed to be overriden by a subclass. It is run
just before C<new()> returns. It is passed a hashref to the arguments passed
to C<new()>.

=head3 Arguments

=over

=item $arg_ref

A hash reference to the hash of arguments passed into the new method.

=back

=head3 Return Value

Does not return a value.

=head2 _connect( )

This is not a method designed for public calling. It is for use only by this
class and it's sub-classes. (A protected method in C++ speak.)

This method connects to the database using DBI. It does it's best to build a
dsn, but if you are supporting a weird database it may get it wrong.

When overriding this method, you must ensure the following:
=over
=item $self->{dbh} contains a handle to the database
=item $self->{connected} is set to one on succesful connection
=back

=head3 Arguments

None.

=head3 Return Value

Does not return a value.

=head2 _get_dbh( )

=head3 Arguments

None.

=head3 Return Value

Returns the connected handle to DBI. Will connect if required.
